# Hi, I am Mohaimen!

I am a:

- Lifelong Learner
- Software Developer
- Educator
- 3rd Year Software Engineering Student

I am currently taking a deep dive into the MERN stack. You can find my projects (and progress) in the pinned repositories!

Currently learning from:

- Front End Masters
- The Odin Project
- Full Stack Open
- FreeCodeCamp

I learn from the videos at FEM and then apply them to projects on TOP. FSO keeps me on track though and provides a clear path towards becoming a proficient web developer. I also dabble a bit on FCC (totally not for the certifications).

I love to learn. That's it.

If you want to join the awesome people at X, Simplified in helping others to code, send me a DM on Twitter @mohaimenhsn.
